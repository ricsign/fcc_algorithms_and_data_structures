# freeCodeCamp JS Algorithms and Data Strutures Solutions

Note: The solutions in this repository are 100% original. These solutions passed all of the test cases provided by the freeCodeCamp.

This project is open-sourced, but it **does not** mean you should copy paste the code. The reasoning stated on the [freeCodeCamp website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/):

> "I understand that plagiarism means copying someone else’s work and presenting the work as if it were my own, without clearly attributing the original author.

> "I understand that plagiarism is an act of intellectual dishonesty, and that people usually get kicked out of university or fired from their jobs if they get caught plagiarizing.

> "Aside from using open source libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap, and short snippets of code which are clearly attributed to their original author, 100% of the code in my projects was written by me, or along with another camper with whom I was pair programming in real time.

> "I pledge that I did not plagiarize any of my freeCodeCamp work. I understand that freeCodeCamp’s team will audit my projects to confirm this."

> In the situations where we discover instances of unambiguous plagiarism, we will replace the camper in question’s certification with a message that "Upon review, this account has been flagged for academic dishonesty."

**Disclaimer: The author of this repository is not responsible for any plagiarism actions and consequences.**
